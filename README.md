# WELCOME *to my world of programming lego blocks*
### Modular Building Blocks

  *Any and all programs, big or small, no matter the programming language, or the tech stack, they are simply lego blocks.*

  *When these lego blocks are pre-built I get a huge warehouse of toolboxes, filled with lego blocks of all shapes and sizes*

  *Now when I am ready to tackle any new project, all that I need to to is to put on my Systems Design thinking hat and architect the system's block diagram.*
  
  *With the blueprint ready, I reach out to my warehouse, look up the tools and build a few versions of POCs for prototypes."*
  
  *Give demos to stake holders, gather feedback, weigh the pros & cons ... "*
  
  *Put up the all the lego blocks together and Voila -- the new project is complete!*
